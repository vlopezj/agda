Installation
************

Debian / Ubuntu
---------------

Prebuilt packages are available for Debian testing/unstable and Ubuntu from Karmic onwards. To install:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install agda-mode

This should install Agda and the Emacs mode.

The standard library is available in Debian testing/unstable and Ubuntu from Lucid onwards. To install:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install agda-stdlib

Fedora
------

Agda is packaged in Fedora (since before Fedora 18).

.. code-block:: bash

  yum install Agda

will pull in emacs-agda-mode and ghc-Agda-devel.

NixOS
-----

Agda is part of the Nixpkgs collection that is used by http://nixos.org/nixos. To install Agda, type:

.. code-block:: bash

  nix-env -iA haskellPackages.Agda

If youâ€™re just interested in the library, you can also install the library without the executable.
Neither the emacs mode nor the Agda standard library are currently installed automatically, though.

OS X
----

`Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ provides prebuilt packages for OS X.  To install:

.. code-block:: bash

  brew install agda

This should take less than a minute, and install Agda together with the Emacs mode and the standard library.

By default, the standard library is installed in ``/usr/local/lib/agda/``.  To use the standard library, it is convenient to add ``/usr/local/lib/agda/standard-library.agda-lib`` to ``~/.agda/libraries``, and specify ``standard-library`` in ``~/.agda/defaults``.  Note this is not performed automatically.

It is also possible to install ``--without-stdlib``, ``--without-ghc``, or from ``--HEAD``.  Note this will require building Agda from source.

For more information, refer to the `Homebrew documentation <http://git.io/brew-docs>`_.
